## Amplify Tools

The "Amplify Tools" aims to provide a seamless integration between Xcode and [Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli). It installs the CLI and executes Amplify-related commands to make sure the iOS project has everything in place so developer can start using it right away.

See the [iOS Getting Started](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/ios/start#step-1-configure-your-app) for more details.
