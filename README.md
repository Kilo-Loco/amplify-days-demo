# amplify-days-demo
The repo for the photo app that was presented during Amplify Days by [Nicki Stone](https://twitter.com/kneekey23) and [Kilo Loco](https://twitter.com/kilo_loco)

### Branches
- `starter` - the starting point of the presentation
- `amplifyDays` - the exact code that was implemented during the demo
- `main` - the original code

### Lambda
We used **Lambda** to detect if a Waterfall was in the image or not so it could update the Photo object to be featured.

Be sure to checkout it out too!!
